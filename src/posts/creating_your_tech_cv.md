## Creating your tech CV

Creating your tech CV shouldn't be a difficult process so I'm here to help simplify the process. Read on to find out all about openers, size, skills, design and format, experience and any additional extras you could think about. 

### The opener
So your opener should be simple and pick out the key accomplishments and things you want the reader to know about. Don't overuse vocabulary there is no need to impress the reader with fancy and clich√© words such as "hard working" and "trust worthy", let your skills, experience and accomplishments do the talking. Let the reader know what position your looking for and what direction you want your career to go in, theres no point lying to a potential employeer about this since your the one whos going to be doing that job should you get it. Importantly, don't be afraid to be confident in what you talk about, if your good at it shout about it. 

### Size
If your CV ends up being 10 pages long you've probably got too much information in there which doesn't need to be there and the reader of the CV is going to get bored and potentially look over important information which makes you stand out from the rest of the competition. On the other hand, if your CV is only a page long then your probably missing out information a potential employer would want to know about. 

Aim for 2-3 pages and make sure you include information that will make you stand out from the crowd. 

Additionally, you don't want to go into too much detail on your CV because there needs to be things to build up on later down the line in the application process. If you don't go into super huge detail it opens up the door for an interviewer to ask you questions in an interview which you can then explain and expand up on the points you mentioned in your CV. Wait for them to bite before realing them in. 

### Technical skills
In the tech bubble now a days there are so many different technical skills you could list and that could end up taking up to a page on your CV so your going to want to only put the relevent stuff down so somebody can see your core skill set. Think about the jobs your applying for
make sure you list all the technical skills that are relevant to that role. Make sure any skills you are putting down like C#, you put what you've actually had experience in since putting C# doesn't tell a reader much. Saying, C# but also listing that you've created web APIs and worked with MVC would be a good example. 

A technical list example could look like:
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Core languages: <b>C# 7+</b>, Asp.Net 4+ (Web APIs and MVC), <b>JavaScript</b> (AngularJS, ReactJS)</li>
    <li>Core Databases: <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b>, MySQL</li>
    <li>Core Tooling: <b>TeamCity</b>, <b>Github Actions</b>, Postman</li>
    <li>Other: <b>Python</b> (Console Apps, Flask), LiteDB, <b>SQLite</b>, Github, Azure, Docker</li>
</ul>

When your writing up experience for job roles it's good to include technical skills as a reference. E.g. I was an application developer for PebblePad, where I worked to develop <b>enterprise</b> level APIs in <b>C# (8.0, .net 4+)</b>. I helped to migrate the company from an outdated <b>MySql</b> database to a docuement based database in <b>MongoDB</b>.

### Experience
This should be the main part of your CV where you give the reader a good view of your experience in the industry and what you've worked on before. An employer will be more likely to hire somebody with experience in the role they're looking for and listing experience in qualities they're looking for is a good way to catch their eye.

Make sure to add measureable results (Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]) so a reader can see what sort of impact you've had on companys before. E.g. Increased API response times by 15% by reworking the database query speed. 

Key points:
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>List your most recent experience first</li>
    <li>Include employer, position and dates in a month-year format (September-2019)</li>
    <li>Keep bullet points simple and clear</li>
    <li>Use action words: created, designed, debugged, negotiated, developed, managed</li>
</ul>

When listing your educational experience include any post secondary insitutions attended, degrees and majors. List your most recent education first and put dates in a month-year format (September-2019). 

Should you have any experience you want to talk about which has links add them in. An employer would find it interesting to checkout what you've worked on. 
Format:
Title [link to project]
Short summary explaining the project and it's purpose. Mention any specific work you did if it's a group project.

### Design and format
Now the design and format of your CV will look different depending on what kind of role your applying for. If your applying for a developer/tester/sys ops role then the design and format would look different to a graphic designer. Keep your CV clear and obvious, make sure the content is clear and easy to read. You don't need any fancy colours or graphics to sell yourself, focus on adding the detail into the CV that will make you stand out from the crowd. 

Key points:
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Simple font and spacing</li>
    <li>Black readable ink</li>
    <li>Format as PDF</li>
    <li>Include contact information at the top with email, LinkedIn and Github profile.</li>
    <li>Use bullet points over paragraphs with consistent formatting and structure.</li>
    <li>If your an experienced developer, list your experience at the top of the CV and then education at the bottom or vise versa if your a new graduate.</li>
</ul>

Format idea:
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Name, Address, Email and Phone number on the left.</li>
    <li>Github Profile and Programming Languages on the right.</li>
    <li>List any good personal projects and notable open source experience towards the start of your CV.</li>
    <li>Add a short simple tag line at the start by contact info. E.g. John Mason, C# and JavaScript fullstack developer with 2 years experience.</li>
</ul>

### Extras
Employers are often interested in what you get up to outside of your normal role. Share any personal projects your proud of but make sure they're complete projects and not those half finished projects all developers have. Add a link to your Github where they can see any other public work you've got, LinkedIn profile or a personal website where you've got something to share. 

Some other topics a potential employeer might be interested in would include publications from yourself, papers published, patents, presentations you've given or involvements you've got in student groups or other groups that could help show off you. Especially, any leadership based roles you may have.
