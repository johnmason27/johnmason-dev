## Who Am I? 
My name is John Mason. I'm an application developer who tends to way more towards the backend side of the stack. When I am doing backend development my preferred programming language is C#. I'm interested in topics such as Web Development, Distributed Systems and Design Patterns. Expect to see post's related to software development including programming and soft skills. 

## Side dish
Alongside development in my personal time and working as a software developer, I enjoy running, watching and attending football games, gaming as well as cooking and food in general. I live a healthy life and enjoy eating healthy to be as fit as possible for my running. 

I train usually 4-5 times a week with a group of runners and are a member of Telford Athletics Club. During a typical week of training I will do between 30-60 miles of running.
