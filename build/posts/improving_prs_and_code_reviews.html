<h2>Improving PRs and Code Reviews</h2>
<h2>Break down the main task üî®</h2>
<p>Start with the initial JIRA ticket which should contain:</p>
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Task descriptions</li>
    <li>Technical details</li>
    <li>Testing conciderations</li>
    <li>Automation testing conciderations</li>
    <li>Definition Of Done</li>
</ul>
<p>Breaking down the ticket into sub-tasks - think of how you can break down the JIRA task into smaller tasks so we can complete the work in smaller stages and create more frequent and smaller pull requests.</p>
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>The tasks can then be created in JIRA using the sub-task feature - they don't need to contain any information, they can just be a title which the team knows about.</li>
    <li>You can then use the sub-task issue name as the branch name for your work.</li>
    <li>We can then create our smaller PR's into a feature branch or master once the work has been completed.</li>
</ul> 
<p>When completing the ticket in JIRA we wouldn't mark the sub-task as <strong>NextVersion</strong>. The main task is the only thing that should be marked as <strong>NextVersion</strong> once all the sub-tasks are completed.</p>
<h2>Small atomic commits ‚öõ</h2>
<p>Use seperate commits for:</p>
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>New features</li>
    <li>Refactoring</li>
    <li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul> 
<p>Avoid batching multiple changes in a single commit.<br />
Each commit should leave the code base in a valid state:</p>
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Tests passing.</li>
    <li>New tests added.</li>
    <li>No silly variable names or code smells.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Work on one sub-task at a time so you can focus on that, complete it quicker and then create a small PR for the work.</p>
<p>Focused commits make it easier to create focused pull requests.</p>
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>You can easily undo commits and changes if your commit contains multiple changes or code smells.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Pull requests are now easier to review because you can view the seperate commits and with each commit containing a valid single change you can review the commits one by one.</p>
<h2>Frequent pushes ‚è©</h2>
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Frequent feedback from peers.</li>
    <li>No risk of losing work.</li>
    <li>More oppurtinities for smaller PRs.</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Frequent small PRs ü§è</h2>
<ul class="bullet-points">
    <li>Keep them small and focused.</li>
    <li>Move refactors into their own pull requests if they are big.</li>
    <li>A pull request should take <b>max ~ 5 mins to review</b>.</li>
    <li>Reviewer should be able to keep the entire PR in their head.</li>
    <li>Have 1 <b>focus</b> per pull request.</li>
</ul>
